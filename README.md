### [Projct 2: Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/MaryamAdel9/Sales-Dashboard)
This project transforms sales data from a flat file into a structured Star Schema model (Fact and Dimension tables). Relationships between tables were carefully created and validated to ensure accurate reporting.

I developed several DAX measures to highlight key insights such as order trends and regional performance. I also used Figma to design a custom background, giving the dashboard a clean and polished look.

Excited to keep growing my skills in data modeling and visualization.
